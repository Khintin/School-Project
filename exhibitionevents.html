                    <p>
                        Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic
                        exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky
                        and what we can see and know about the universe around
                        us. We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies
                        that can be seen and learn a bit about the early
                        navigators who used the stars to travel by. Follow the
                        journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab
                        traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest
                        exploration of the planets in our solar system.

                        <p>
                            For centuries, philosophers and scientists have
                            wrestled with the question of our origins. Where do
                            we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin
                            proposed his theory of evolution we have had a
                            framework for exploring and understanding our place
                            in this world.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            the origins of life on this planet and how the
                            species we know today have evolved our time. You can
                            also take some time to meet a few of the creatures
                            who didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth,
                            the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.

                    <p>
                        From micro-organisms to the human body, major
                        breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique insights
                        into the great wonders of the tiny world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For many people their life expectancy is much longer and
                        their quality of life much improved, thanks to the
                        growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series
                        of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take
                        a look at some major breakthroughs including the
                        discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only
                        from the lab, but also from observing animals in the
                        wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.

                        The information revolution is here and robotics and
                        artificial intelligence are the science of the future.
                        From useful home applications of AI to industrial uses
                        of robotics, the future is here. You can even say hello
                        and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.

                        As we learn more and more of the impact humans are
                        having on the planet, the more important it becomes that
                        scientists explore how to create a sustainable future
                        not just for humans but for the whole planet.

                    <p>
                        In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the
                        dangers we currently face including global warming,
                        extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus
                        on the positive ways we can all contribute to a brighter
                        future.
